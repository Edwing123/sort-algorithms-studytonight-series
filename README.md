# Learning about sorting algorithms

Following the tutorials from [Studytonight intro to sorting](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/introduction-to-sorting).


## Concepts from tutorial

### What is sorting ?

Sorting is nothing but arranging the data in ascending or descending order. The term **sorting** came into picture, as humans realised the importance of searching quickly.

There are so many things in our real life that we need to search for, like a particular record in database, roll numbers in merit list, a particular phone number in a telephone directory, a particular page in a book, etc. All this would have been a mess if the data was kept unordered and unsorted, but fortunately the concept of sorting came into existence, making it easier for everyone to arrange data in an order, hence making it easier to search.

Sorting arranges data in a sequence which makes searching easier.


## The two main criterias to judge which algorithm is better than the other have been:

- Time taken to sort the given data.
- Memory Space required to do so.


# Different sorting algorithms

There are many different techniques available for sorting, differentiated by their efficiency and space requirements. 
Following are some sorting techniques:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Heap Sort


### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm which is used to sort a given set of `n` elements provided in form of an array with `n` number of elements. Bubble Sort compares all the elements one by one and sort them based on their values.
